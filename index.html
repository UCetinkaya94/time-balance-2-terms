        <h2>In-app Purchases</h2>
        The Application may include In-app Purchases that allow you to buy products, services or Subscriptions.

        <p>More information about how you may be able to manage In-app Purchases using your Device may be set out in the
            Application Store's own terms and conditions or in your Device's Help settings.</p>

        <p>In-app Purchases can only be consumed within the Application. If you make an In-app Purchase, that In-app
            Purchase cannot be canceled after you have initiated its download. In-app Purchases cannot be redeemed for
            cash
            or other consideration or otherwise transferred.</p>

        <p>If any In-app Purchase is not successfully downloaded or does not work once it has been successfully
            downloaded,
            we will, after becoming aware of the fault or being notified of the fault by You, investigate the reason for
            the
            fault. We will act reasonably in deciding whether to provide You with a replacement In-app Purchase or issue
            You
            with a patch to repair the fault. In no event will We charge You to replace or repair the In-app Purchase.

            so
            within a reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to You, We will authorize the
            Application Store to refund You an amount up to the cost of the relevant In-app Purchase. Alternatively, if
            You
            wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application Store directly.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge and agree that all billing and transaction processes are handled by the Application Store
            from
            where you downloaded the Application and are governed by that Application Store's own terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <p>If you have any payment related issues with In-app Purchases, then you need to contact the Application
            Store
            directly.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall the company, its officers, directors, agents, affiliates, employees, advertisers, or data
            providers be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages (including but
            not limited to loss of use, loss of profits, or loss of data) whether in an action in contract, tort
            (including but not limited to negligence), equity, or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with
            the use of this app. The company's total liability arising out of or in connection with these terms or from
            the use of or inability to use the app will not exceed the amounts you have paid to the company for use of
            the app, if any. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, so the above
            limitations may not apply to you. The company and any third parties mentioned on the app are not liable for
            any personal injury caused by your use or misuse of the app.</p>

        <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of
            any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf
            of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all

            limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of
            any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work
            with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any
            performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
            corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
            representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the

        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
            But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
            extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
